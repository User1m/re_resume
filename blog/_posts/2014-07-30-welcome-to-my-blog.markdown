##My first post!

Hi there! I'm a young and hungry entrepreneur who is passionate bout family, travel, code, technology, sports, food, women, and startups…not in any particular order. In my free time I love spending time with friends and family, building things from scratch and seeing them work, and keeping up on startup news. My ultimate goal in life is traveling to new places, meeting new people, and exploring new cultures. By the time I am 40 I want to have seen most of the world!

That being said, this is my first real attempt at doing some free writing. For years I’ve been telling myself that I’ll begin …and well I must’ve ran out of excuses. Regardless, on here I’ll be candidly talking about anything and everything that pops into my mind. From my morning commute to work, to my inspirations, to a new rap song that I’m stick on, to projects I’m working on, to movies I’ve seen, even women (yes!).

So thanks for visiting and hope you find something that inspires or moves you today.
